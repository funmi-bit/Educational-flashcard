        "question": "Explain the concept of gravitational force.",
        "answer": "Gravitational force is the attractive force between two masses. Sir Isaac Newton described it in his law of universal gravitation, stating that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers."

    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.",
      "answer": "Supply and demand are fundamental economic principles.The law of supply states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied also increases, while the law of demand states that as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.The intersection of these curves determines the market equilibrium."
