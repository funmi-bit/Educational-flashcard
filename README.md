# Educational-flashcard
This is the begining of my flashcard application.
its a basic application that only flips when user hover around the flashcard but doesn't work when view answer button is clicked.

This application is modified to be an interactive flashcard tool where users can create, view, and interact with flashcards. Users can input questions and answers, add flashcards, and navigate through them using arrow buttons. The double-click functionality reveals the answer. The "Create Flashcard" page allows users to input questions and answers, add flashcards, and view their progress.
