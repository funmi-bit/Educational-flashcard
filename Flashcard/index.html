                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="secondAnswer"> Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy,
                    producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts.
                    This process is crucial for the plant's growth and sustenance,
                    and it also plays a vital role in maintaining oxygen levels in the atmosphere.</p>

                <p>Question 3:</p>
                <p class="thirdQuestion"> How does the water cycle contribute to Earth's ecosystems?</p>
                <input type="text" class="thirdInput">
            </div>
            <div class="thirdQuestionBack">
                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="thirdAnswer"> The water cycle involves the continuous movement of water between the
                    atmosphere, land, and oceans through processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and
                    runoff.
                    This cycle sustains life by providing freshwater for plants, animals, and human populations,
                    influencing weather patterns and supporting diverse ecosystems.</p>

                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="fourthAnswer">DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information in living organisms.
                    It contains instructions for the development, functioning, and reproduction of cells.
                    The sequence of nucleotides in DNA molecules determines the genetic code, influencing an organism's
                    traits and characteristics.</p>

                <p>Question 5:</p>
                <p class="fifthQuestion">Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.</p>
                <input type="text" class="fifthInput">
            </div>
            <div class="fifthQuestionBack">
                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="fifthAnswer">Supply and demand are fundamental economic principles.
                    The law of supply states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied
                    also increases,
                    while the law of demand states that as the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.
                    The intersection of these curves determines the market equilibrium.</p>

                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="sixthAnswer">The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat in the Earth's atmosphere by
                    certain gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. While essential for maintaining a habitable
                    temperature, human activities,
                    such as burning fossil fuels, enhance this effect, leading to global warming and contributing to
                    climate change.</p>

                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="seventhAnswer">The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized
                    based on their atomic number and electron configuration.
                    It provides essential information about the properties and relationships of elements, aiding in the
                    understanding of chemical behavior and the prediction of element properties.</p>

                    their non-living environment.
                    An example is a forest ecosystem, where trees, plants, animals, and microorganisms coexist and
                    interact within a specific geographical area.</p>

                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="ninethAnswer">Mitochondria are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of the cell.
                    They are responsible for cellular respiration, a process that converts nutrients into energy in the
                    form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), providing the energy needed for various cellular activities.

                <p>Answer:</p>
                <p class="tenthAnswer">Gravitational force is the attractive force between two masses. Sir Isaac Newton
                    described it in his law of universal gravitation,
                    stating that every mass attracts every other mass in the universe with a force proportional to the
                    product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their
                    centers..</p>
